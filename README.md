# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
Kaggle competition : [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)

## Introduction
I would like to apply what I learnt in a real world dataset. 
My goal is to use multiple approach 
(Logistic Regression, Deep Neural Network, SVM and Random Forests) 
to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

# Result
Using random forest, we had achieved an accuracy of 0.81100, which is ranked 471 / 15934 (top 3%) on the Kaggle leaderboard.
